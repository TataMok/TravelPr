        <h2>Why Switzerland?</h2>
        <h3>Reasons to Visit Switzerland</h3>
        <p>Hiking Experience Unlike Any Other
        There are two reasons why the hiking industry is so prominent in Switzerland. Firstly, it’s the Alpine countryside,
        which deserves its own spot on the list. The endless array of hiking trails offer a sheer number of eye-captivating
        landscapes that can be found all throughout Switzerland, no matter where you look. Grand snowcapped Alp mountains, lush
        spreads of dense pine tree forests, calm rivers that mimic the sky in their hue, all create a scenery right out of a
        kid’s dream.
        
        Secondly, the majority of the hiking trails are well maintained, especially those that lay their path in close proximity
        to the marvelous Alps. If you are unsure of how to start off your list of things to do in Switzerland, then we suggest
        that you get to know the flora and fauna of the country that peacefully lives there by going for a hike!

            Grindelwald Village - Fairytale Land on Earth
            Many travelers to Switzerland find themselves discovering Grindelwald Village only after they’ve returned from their
            trip. Don’t let this happen to you! This iconic place would be a great reason why visit Switzerland for the second time.
            Imagine a village from a fairytale, surrounded by a forest of all shades of green and the Bernese Alps that cover the
            village from the Northside. When the winter rolls around and the village is covered by a light dusting of snow, it
            obtains a new beautiful setting, which can be seen in some of the Star Wars and James Bond films. If the accommodations
            aren’t already fully booked, then you can even stay there to experience the magic of the village firsthand.

            Swiss Art Galleries
            Art in Switzerland is treated with the utmost respect and is cherished, as it is a mirror into the past through which
            ancestors’ lives and culture can be understood. Although Switzerland lacks in the quantity of its own art, it makes up
            for in a broad range of museums with collections of art from every corner of Europe, each specializing in a particular
            time period, be it contemporary, modern, or abstract. As for Swiss art, a lot of it revolves around folk art: poetry,
            wood carvings, embroidery, and music which involves the yodel, a type of singing with rapid alternation between high
            falsetto and low chest notes.

            Train Rides Like Nowhere Else
            With the countless number of scenic views that are out in the open, it is improbable that you will have time to visit
            all of them on your first trip to Switzerland. Or is it? Switzerland’s brilliant public transportation facility has
            cable cars and trains that run through the most astonishing parts of the country that could not be accessible by foot.
            So take a scenic train ride that runs in between two mountains and get a glimpse at nature from a new angle. Use the
            opportunity to delve into photography or take a photo on your phone. It’s worth a story post for sure! All the trains,
            just like Swiss watches, are incredibly punctual and arrive precisely on time, so planning your journey around the
            country by train is going to be not only a spectacular adventure, but one where you will always be on time.

                Bern's Old City
                The Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the heart of Bern. Its arcades do not only protect us from the rain and
                the sun, they also house a plethora of unique shops and stylish boutiques. One special feature of the Old City are the
                bars and restaurants in the vaulted cellars – in the past, the sandstone cellars were used to store supplies, now
                they’re filled with hip beer bars, ateliers, or second-hand shops.
